# QUESTION 4.1:
# I have a list of things I need to buy from my supermarket of choice.
# shopping_list = [
#     "oranges",
#     "cat food",
#     "sponge cake",
#     "long-grain rice",
#     "cheese board",
# ]
#
# print(shopping_list[1])
#
# I want to know what the first thing I need to buy is.
# However, when I run the program it shows me a different answer to what I was expecting?
# What is the mistake? How do I fix it?

# ANSWER:
# Change index from 1 to 0.
# Indexes always start at 0, so shopping_list[0] will give first item.

shopping_list = [
    "oranges",
    "cat food",
    "sponge cake",
    "long-grain rice",
    "cheese board",
]

print(shopping_list[0])
